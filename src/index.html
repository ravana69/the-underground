Inspired by && Adapted from Marcin Ignac's JS1K 2010 Entry:
Wobbling Tunnel 
Found on his website: 
http://marcinignac.com/experiments/tunnel-1k/
along with the link for the Demo Source Code: 
http://marcinignac.com/experiments/tunnel-1k/tunnel-1k.js
His source is minified (by hand) - but it's so smart I had to redo it, so this has been completely rewritten && modified to give it a look && feel of my own.
